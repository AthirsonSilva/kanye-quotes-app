# kanye-quotes-app
A simple Kanye West quotes app that contains a GUI with a Kanye West emoji with a onclick function that changes the quote displayed on the screen everytime the user clicks the Kanye West emoji button. The quotes came from a JSON database in the Kanye Rest API using the Request Python library, and the Graphical User Interface and the programming were made with Python and TKInter.
